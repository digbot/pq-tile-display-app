  question: How to use Type Guards in TypeScript ?
  answer: |
    Type Guards are a TypeScript feature that allows developers to narrow down the type of a variable within a conditional block. They are particularly useful when dealing with union types or when the type of a variable cannot be determined by TypeScriptâ€™s static analysis alone.
  example: |
    let isDone: boolean = false;
    let decimal: number = 6;
    let color: string = "blue";
